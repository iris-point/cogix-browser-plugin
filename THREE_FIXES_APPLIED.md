# 🔧 Three Critical Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified & Solved

### ❌ **Issue 1: Cancel Button Overlapping Calibration Points**

**Problem**: Cancel button was positioned `top: 20px, right: 20px` which could overlap with calibration points in the corners.

**Solution**: Moved cancel button to bottom center
```typescript
// OLD: Top-right corner (could overlap with calibration points)
top: 20px !important;
right: 20px !important;

// NEW: Bottom center (safe zone, no overlap)
bottom: 50px !important;
left: 50% !important;
transform: translateX(-50%) !important;
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No overlap with any of the 5 calibration points
- ✅ Clearly visible and accessible
- ✅ Professional styling with hover effects
- ✅ Clear labeling: "✕ Cancel Calibration (ESC)"

### ❌ **Issue 2: Popup Status Not Synced with Background**

**Problem**: When popup reopened, it showed "disconnected" even though background script maintained the connection.

**Solution**: Added status polling and immediate sync
```typescript
// Get status immediately when popup opens
const updateStatus = () => {
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'EYE_TRACKER_STATUS' }, (response) => {
    setDeviceStatus(response.status)
  })
}

updateStatus() // Immediate
const statusInterval = setInterval(updateStatus, 2000) // Every 2 seconds
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Popup always shows correct connection status
- ✅ Real-time sync with background connection
- ✅ Automatic updates every 2 seconds
- ✅ Immediate status on popup open

### ❌ **Issue 3: Camera View Not Updated in Popup**

**Problem**: Camera frames were only sent to content scripts, not to the popup.

**Solution**: Enhanced broadcasting to include popup
```typescript
// In EyeTrackerManager
private broadcastCameraFrame(frame) {
  // Send to all tabs (existing)
  chrome.tabs.query({}, (tabs) => { ... })
  
  // NEW: Also send to popup
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
    type: 'CAMERA_FRAME',
    frame: frame
  })
}

// In popup context
case 'CAMERA_FRAME':
  const cameraImages = document.querySelectorAll('.eye-tracker-camera-image')
  cameraImages.forEach((img: HTMLImageElement) => {
    img.src = `data:image/jpeg;base64,${message.frame.imageData}`
  })
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Real-time camera feed in popup
- ✅ Camera view updates even when popup reopened
- ✅ Consistent with content script camera handling
- ✅ Works with persistent background connection

## 🎯 Complete Architecture Overview

### **Background Script (Persistent)**
```
EyeTrackerManager (Singleton)
├── WebSocket Connection (Persistent)
├── Event Listeners (Always Active)
├── Data Broadcasting (To All Components)
└── Connection Management (Independent)
```

### **Popup (UI State Only)**
```
EyeTrackerContext (React)
├── Status Display (Synced with Background)
├── User Controls (Send Commands to Background)
├── Camera View (Receives Frames from Background)
└── Real-time Updates (Via Message Polling)
```

### **Content Scripts (Per-Tab)**
```
Unified Overlay
├── Recording Controls (Independent)
├── Calibration UI (Fullscreen Overlay)
├── Gaze Visualization (During Recording)
└── Event Handling (From Background)
```

## 🔄 Message Flow (Fixed)

### **Status Sync**
```
Background: Connection Status Change
    ↓
Background: Broadcast to popup + tabs
    ↓
Popup: Receives status update
    ↓
Popup: UI reflects correct status
```

### **Camera Feed**
```
Eye Tracker: Camera Frame
    ↓
Background: Receives frame
    ↓
Background: Broadcast to popup + tabs
    ↓
Popup: Camera view updates
Content Scripts: Camera overlays update
```

### **Calibration**
```
Popup: Start Calibration Button
    ↓
Content Script: Fullscreen + UI
    ↓
Background: Eye Tracker Calibration
    ↓
Background: Broadcast Progress
    ↓
Content Script: Update Calibration Points
```
