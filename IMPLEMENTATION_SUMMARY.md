# Screen Recording with Eye Tracking - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented simultaneous screen recording and eye tracking data collection in the browser extension, with complete data pipeline integration to cogix-data-io and CogixStudio visualization.

## Completed Features

### ✅ 1. Recording Button Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Recording button showed "connect to eye tracker" despite being connected.

**Solution**: 
- Improved status synchronization between background script and content script
- Added real-time status checking via `EYE_TRACKER_STATUS` message
- Implemented fallback to storage-based status checking
- Added comprehensive error logging and user feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contents/unified-overlay.ts` - Enhanced status checking logic

### ✅ 2. Video Upload Implementation
**Feature**: Upload recorded video files to cogix-backend and receive CDN URLs.

**Implementation**:
- Created `uploadVideoToBackend()` function
- Uses FormData with proper authentication headers
- Uploads to `/api/v1/project-files/{projectId}/upload` endpoint
- Returns signed CDN URL for video access
- Includes error handling and retry logic

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contents/unified-overlay.ts` - Added video upload functionality

### ✅ 3. Session Data Submission to DataIO
**Feature**: Submit complete session data (with video URLs) to cogix-data-io service.

**Implementation**:
- Created `submitSessionToDataIO()` function
- Integrated with existing API key management system
- Uses proper data format for cogix-data-io compatibility
- Includes authentication retry logic
- Caches API keys for performance

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contents/unified-overlay.ts` - Added session data submission
- `cogix-frontend/components/eye-tracking-adapters/CogixStudioAdapter.tsx` - Updated API key retrieval

### ✅ 4. Integrated Recording Workflow
**Feature**: Complete end-to-end workflow from recording to visualization.

**Implementation**:
- Updated `finalizeRecording()` function with complete pipeline
- Sequential process: Record → Upload Video → Get URL → Submit Session Data
- Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- Local storage fallback for failed uploads
- Progress indicators throughout the process

**Workflow**:
1. User starts recording (screen + eye tracking)
2. Data collected simultaneously (video frames + gaze points)
3. Recording stops → video uploaded to backend
4. CDN URL received → embedded in session data
5. Complete session submitted to cogix-data-io
6. Success feedback shown to user

### ✅ 5. CogixStudio Integration
**Feature**: Visualization of recorded sessions in CogixStudio.

**Implementation**:
- Updated CogixStudioAdapter to use DataIOStorageProvider
- Integrated with existing API key system
- Added proper error handling for data-io access
- URL parameter `?storage=dataio` activates DataIO mode

**Files Modified**:
- `cogix-frontend/components/eye-tracking-adapters/CogixStudioAdapter.tsx`
