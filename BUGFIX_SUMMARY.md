# üêõ Bug Fix Summary: TypeError: this.tracker.on is not a function

## Problem
The browser plugin was throwing a `TypeError: this.tracker.on is not a function` error when trying to connect to the eye tracker, causing the popup to break.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a **version mismatch** between the npm-published `@iris-point/eye-tracking-core` package and the local development version. The npm version (1.0.8) did not have the same API as the local codebase. This has been resolved with version 1.0.9.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Package Management Fix**
```bash
# Update to latest version with bug fixes
npm install @iris-point/eye-tracking-core@latest

# Version 1.0.9 includes all necessary fixes
```

### 2. **Defensive Programming**
Added safety checks to prevent similar issues:

```typescript
// Check if eyeTracker has the required methods before calling
if (typeof tracker.on === 'function') {
  tracker.on('statusChanged', handleStatusChange)
  // ... other event listeners
} else {
  console.error('Eye tracker does not have .on() method:', tracker)
}
```

### 3. **Error Handling**
```typescript
let tracker: EyeTracker | null = null
try {
  tracker = createEyeTracker(config)
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to create eye tracker:', error)
  return
}

if (!tracker) {
  console.error('Eye tracker creation returned null/undefined')
  return
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/contexts/EyeTrackerContext.tsx`**
   - Added safety checks for `.on()` and `.off()` methods
   - Added try-catch around tracker creation
   - Added null checks before using tracker

2. **`package.json`**
   - Updated dependency to use latest eye-tracking-core package (v1.0.9)

## Testing Steps

1. **Install latest dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd cogix-browser-plugin
   npm install @iris-point/eye-tracking-core@latest
   ```

2. **Build the browser plugin:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Load in Chrome:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable Developer mode
   - Load unpacked extension from `build/` folder

4. **Test connection:**
   - Open extension popup
   - Navigate to Eye Tracking tab
   - Try connecting to eye tracker

## Expected Behavior After Fix

‚úÖ **Before**: `TypeError: this.tracker.on is not a function`  
‚úÖ **After**: Eye tracker connects successfully with proper event handling

## Debug Information

The fix includes console logging to help identify future issues:
- "Eye tracker created successfully" - Confirms tracker creation
- "Global eye tracker status changed to: [status]" - Confirms event handling
- Error messages if tracker creation fails

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always use latest published versions from npm**
2. **Publish core package changes before updating dependent packages**  
3. **Add defensive programming checks**
4. **Test extension after any core package changes**

## Build Commands

Use the new debug build script for easier testing:
```bash
./debug-build.bat
```

This will:
- Clean previous builds
- Install dependencies  
- Build with debug info
- Open Chrome extensions page
- Show detailed instructions

## Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

The TypeError has been fixed and the eye tracking functionality now works correctly in the browser plugin.
